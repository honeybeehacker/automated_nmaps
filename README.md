# automated_nmaps
A shell script to automate initial reconnaissance nmap scans of a single target IP with an optional nmap scripts scan at the end. I got tired of typing the same nmap commands over and over. 

I use these scans for first steps of active information gathering to enumerate the target. 

# usage:
sudo ./automated_nmaps.sh
enter target IP
after first three scans enter "yes" or "no" for scripts
